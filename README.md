## This the repository for 3494's 2025 robot Lambda!
Featuring:
  - A Single Stage Elevator
    - With magnetic encoder for activ zeroing
  - Dual Use Intake
      - with an absolute encoder to montior arm rotation
  - Auto Align and April Tag relocalization
    - Specialized Pose Estimation
    - Swerve drive with full field odometery and a simplified Kalman filter
  - Finite State Machine (Lets be real this is a couple freaking booleans)
      - Intake current monitoring
      - Algea Mode and Coral Mode with influence auto align and arm power
  - Special Odometery tunning functions
    - Automatic wheel zeroing
    - Wheel radius tunning based on the IMU
  - Full Robot Logging
    - Logs both the Inputs and outputs of every subsystem allow full robot replay
